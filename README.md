# collapsingNav
A fully responsive navigation solution that collapses into a hidden sub-nav on window resize when nav items do not fit on the page

Please note - this is a pure JavaScript ES6 solution. To use this today in all browsers, you will need to transpile this into Babel (https://babeljs.io/).
